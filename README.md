# KP-NILM
NILM by using multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP).

This is a naïve prototype/demonstration that was initially used when exploring different concepts of UNILM.

If you use my code in your research please cite our UNILM research paper (IEEE example):

A. Rodriguez-Silva and S. Makonin, “Universal Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (UNILM) Using Filter Pipelines, Probabilistic Knapsack, and Labelled Partition Maps,” p. 6, 2019.
